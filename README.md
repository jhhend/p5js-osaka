# p5js-osaka

Generative art piece utilizing a grid of polygons with removed sections.

Left mouse click will re-generate a new piece, and right click will download the image.

Named 'Osaka' since the pattern is inspired by an art piece seen in the background of a scene in John Wick: Chapter 4 which takes place in Osaka.

At the time of creation the movie is still in theaters and so the best images I can find to showcase the pattern can be seen here: [1](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c3b4ca/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5d%2F84%2F557439d746f485a932e54d31799f%2Fjw4-unit-210729-00318-r.jpg) [2](https://preview.redd.it/noticed-2-things-v0-vaxgsqm8p1ja1.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=eb15cb2e3610726ecc298e10a257b17921eaefcd)
